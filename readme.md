Ben Vaughan-Jones
==================
A former Operations Manager in retail turned software developer with the help of Makers Academy. Finally fulfilling a lifelong ambition to be a software engineer. Currently looking to get stuck in to my tech career in London, where I can add to my current knowledge in full stack development.

I would contribute to a team, passion for code mixed with good software craftmanship principles that I developed during my time at Makers Academy. In addition to the hard skills I developed at Makers Academy, I also bring enthusiasm, I'm a good team player who doesn't mind getting stuck in when required and a personality that naturally makes people feel comfortable.

Full stack junior developer, recently completed 16 weeks [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) bootcamp.
